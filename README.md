# Budget_Remake
Kind of neat redoing the budget project. I was able to do this in a fraction of the time and have it take a fraction of the lines. Interesting to see how much I've learned.

My first big python project was one that allowed you to create a budget that tracks your spending through a few premade categories. I remember, this program was fairly long, taking up around 200 lines. I recently remade it and not only can you create your own categories while not losing any of the features, the program only takes up a fraction of the lines.
